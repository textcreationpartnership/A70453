            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And although it be but a Brief Abſtract (which is ever beſt for Memory) of what others have delivered more at large; yet the diligent Reader may perhaps find ſome Remarkable Things, which otherwiſe he might not eaſily meet withal.</p>
                  <p>The other more Particular, entituled, <hi>Some Antiquities touching</hi> CHESHIRE: And this is divided into four Parts, whereof the three firſt concern that County in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but the fourth Part treats onely of the Antiquities of <hi>Bucklow-Hundred.</hi>

                        <p>⚜ This Deſcent carrieth great uncertainty, both for the defect of time wherein each lived, and alſo for want of Authority vouched; but chiefly, for that <hi>Bedwig,</hi> the firſt here named, is made the Son of <hi>Sem:</hi> Howbeit the later part of it is very true; but the making of <hi>Bedwig</hi> Son of <hi>Sem,</hi> is either foiſted into the Copy by ſome ignorant Perſon, or elſe is to be underſtood as deſcended from <hi>Sem</hi> originally, not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham, Matthew, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. For <hi>Sem</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah</hi> died <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2158. <hi>&amp; Anno poſt Diluvium</hi> 502. which was 1790 Years before <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born: And no Learned Man, verſed in Antiquities, can imagine the Deſcents here reckoned up to <hi>Bedwig</hi> from King <hi>Alfred,</hi> to exceed 1000 Years: So that reckoning from <hi>Alfred</hi>'s death, which was in <hi>Anno</hi> 899. it cannot be ſuppoſed that theſe Deſcents can reach much above the time of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Birth, if they reach ſo high, admitting them to be exactly true ſo far as they reach; which would yet fall ſhort 1700 Years from the death of <hi>Sem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides we find no ſuch Son of <hi>Sem,</hi> as <hi>Bedwig,</hi> mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures: And if we well obſerve the third Chapter of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> we ſhall find 66 Deſcents recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up between <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> containing the Revolution of 2000 Years and more, if we account the Age wherein <hi>Sem</hi> lived: And S. <hi>Matthew</hi> reckons up onely 52 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents to that time by another Line, beſides three Kings omitted by him between <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> and <hi>Ozias,</hi> for ſome Reaſons beſt known to the Holy Spirit of God; which will better appear by comparing S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. with 1 <hi>Chron. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. So as the whole Deſcents therein make up onely 55. And although ſome Mens Lives are longer, and ſome ſhorter, yet the Generations carry ſome proportion one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as we may eaſily obſerve in others where the Deſcents are exactly put down.</p>
                        <p>But now between <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Alfred</hi> are onely 37 Deſcents here reckoned up, which cannot comprehend above 1000 Years; and between <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Alfred</hi> are effluxed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55739:17"/>
2690 Years, accounting from both their deaths: So that unleſs ſome Deſcents be here skipped over in many places, it is impoſſible that any of theſe ſhould reach the Age of <hi>Sem;</hi> and then theſe cannot be exact and true Deſcents through. Beſides, thoſe more ancient Deſcents between <hi>Bedwig</hi> and <hi>Gewis,</hi> not having been proved by ſome good Authority, may yield them uncertain to relie upon.</p>

                           <hi>Cambden</hi> and <hi>Verſtegan</hi> tell us, That the <hi>Saxons</hi> termed all Aliens and Strangers <hi>Walſh.</hi> And hence they called theſe Inhabitants (becauſe Strangers unto them) by the name of <hi>Walſh-men,</hi> and their Countrey <hi>Wales.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But more probable it is, that foraſmuch as they be deſcended from the ancient <hi>Gaules,</hi> their Neighbors, in <hi>Latin</hi> termed <hi>Galli,</hi> by the <hi>French, Galles,</hi> which the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> pronounce <hi>Walles,</hi> and from whence <hi>Walles-man,</hi> and now corruptly <hi>Welſh-man;</hi> it ſeems to me to be thence called <hi>Wales,</hi> as one ſhould ſay, <hi>The Countrey of the Waules,</hi> or <hi>Walles:</hi> And in ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Authors it is many times ſtiled <hi>Guallia,</hi> and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof <hi>Gualli;</hi> and every Man knows how the <hi>Saxons</hi> in moſt Words do uſe <hi>W</hi> for <hi>G;</hi> as <hi>War</hi> for <hi>Guerre, Ward</hi> for <hi>Guard,</hi> and the like: And at this day the <hi>French</hi> ſtile the eldeſt Son of the King of <hi>England, Le Prince de Galles.</hi> The ancient <hi>Galli</hi> were called <hi>Cimbri,</hi> or <hi>Kimbri, undè Cambro-Britannia</hi> is uſed for <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Cambro-Britannus</hi> for a <hi>Welſhman.</hi> And ask theſe <hi>Cambro-Brittans,</hi> or <hi>Welſh-Brittans,</hi> how they call themſelves, they will preſently tell you, <hi>Kimeri,</hi> or <hi>Kumeri;</hi> which ſounds as much as <hi>Kimbri,</hi> or <hi>Kymbry,</hi> now in <hi>Latin</hi> molded into <hi>Cambri.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Howſoever the Name came, the Inhabitants of <hi>Wales</hi> at this day are the Remnant of the Ancient <hi>Brettans;</hi> but not without great commixture of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, which muſt needs follow in ſo long a Tract of time: And yet have they preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Native Language, but with ſome corruption of various Dialects.</p>
                        <p>For the Deſcription of <hi>Wales,</hi> it was anciently bounded from <hi>England</hi> with the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Severn;</hi> all the reſt of it, almoſt, is bounded with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Seas: But <hi>Offa,</hi> the Puiſſant King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> drave the <hi>Brettans</hi> from the Rivers aforeſaid, and forced them up to the Mountains of <hi>Wales,</hi> where he cauſed them to be divided from <hi>England</hi> by a very great Ditch, called by the <hi>Engliſh, Offa's Dike,</hi> at this day. This was about the Year ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Birth 760. and it began at the River <hi>Dee</hi> by <hi>Baſing-werk,</hi> between <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Ruthlan,</hi> and ſo ran along the ſides of the Hills to

the <hi>South Sea,</hi> a little from <hi>Briſtow,</hi> reaching near a hundred Miles in length, and is in many places yet to be ſeen. The Countrey between it and <hi>England,</hi> is commonly called by the <hi>Welſh,-Y Mars;</hi> though the greateſt part of it be now inhabited with <hi>Welſhmen,</hi> namely in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> which yet keepeth the ancient Limits to the River <hi>Dee,</hi> or <hi>Dwy,</hi> and in ſome Places over it. <hi>Powell</hi> on the <hi>Welſh Hiſtory, pag.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p>According to <hi>Cambden,</hi> it was divided into theſe ſorts of Inhabitants, in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and before.</p>
                        <p>But this was long before it had the Name of <hi>Wales.</hi>

Where is to be obſerved, That this Hiſtory of <hi>Brute</hi> was rather deviſed to amaze and miſguide Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than poſſibly to be believed; and that by an impudent lying Author, <hi>Geffrey of Monmouth,</hi> who lived but about the Year of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 1160. and 2260 Years after <hi>Brute</hi> lived, as they place the time, without ſo much as vouching any one Author for any thing thereof; which <hi>Geffrey</hi> was taxed for a lying Author by <hi>William of Newbury,</hi> a Man living in the ſame Age with him: The words of <hi>William</hi> concerning that <hi>Geffrey</hi> ſee before in this Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 10.. <hi>Vide etiàm Doctiſſimum Cambdenum in Britanniâ ſuâ, pag.</hi> 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.</p>

So that we ſee <hi>Brute</hi> muſt be made a True <hi>Trojan,</hi> and to be deſcended from <hi>Javan</hi> Son of <hi>Japhet,</hi> from whom the <hi>Ionians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith) were propagated.</p>
                        <p>Here, by the way, obſerve, That <hi>St. Luke</hi> reckons up onely 66 Deſcents between <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Chriſt, cap.</hi> 3. Yet the Deſcent of <hi>Caſſibelan</hi> (who lived a little before the time of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Birth) muſt be made to contain 70 Deſcents to <hi>Brute,</hi> and 22 more to <hi>Noah,</hi> in all 92 Deſcents to <hi>Noah:</hi> So they will make ſure to give the <hi>Brettans</hi> Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents enough.

                        <p>BUt ſo far as good Authority of Approved Authors will direct me, I ſhall now put down. Firſt then, it is certain that the <hi>Brettans</hi> Inhabited this Iſland in <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s Age, and before; and it is probable they inhabited here ſome hundreds of Years before: but when firſt inhabited, appeareth not by any good Hiſtorian. It is agreed by the moſt Learned Men, that before <hi>Caeſar</hi> we have no certaine Hiſtory of <hi>Brettain</hi> left us; and that the <hi>Druids</hi> of the <hi>Brettans</hi> (who were their moſt Learned Men) never committed any thing to writing.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall therefore begin with what Rulers of <hi>Brettaine</hi> I find recorded in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s time, and downwards; I mean, of the <hi>Brettans</hi> who Ruled, (for I have already ſet down the <hi>Roman</hi> Rulers of <hi>Brettaine ſupra, pag.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp; deinceps;</hi> who indeed caſhir'd the <hi>Brettans,</hi> and their Authority) beginning with <hi>Caſſibellaun,</hi> and vouching my Authors all along.</p>

Perhaps the Name <hi>Caſſibelline</hi> is derived from <hi>Caſſi,</hi> a People of <hi>Hartfordſhire:</hi> The Reliques of their Name we have yet in <hi>Caſhow</hi>-Hundred: And ſo <hi>Caſſibelin</hi> ſounds as much as <hi>Caſſorum Princeps,</hi> or <hi>Prince of the Caſſians: Cambden</hi>'s <hi>Britannia,</hi> in his Preface before <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Cattieuclani.</hi> The Town of <hi>Caſſibelaun,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was <hi>St. Albons</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> called <hi>Verulamium</hi> by <hi>Tacitus: Cambden in Hartfordſhire.</hi>

                        <p>Probably when the King gave unto his Son <hi>John, Dominium Hiberniae,</hi> 1176, it was as much as King of <hi>Ireland</hi> in effect, whereby the Supreme Power was implied; and from thence we ſee he aſſumed the Title of <hi>Dominus Hiberniae</hi> afterwards: But it is not probable, that the King did create him <hi>Regem Hiberniae</hi> by Charter (though poſſibly he might ſometimes be ſo called) for then he would have aſſumed the Title of <hi>Rex Hiberniae,</hi> and not of <hi>Dominus Hiberniae,</hi> which afterwards we find he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but never <hi>Rex Hiberniae.</hi>

                        <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Iſland of <hi>Great Brettaine</hi> was altogether unknown both to the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> until the Days of <hi>Caius Julius Caeſar. Bede de Hiſtoriâ Gentis Anglorum, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. Learned <hi>Cambden,</hi> in his <hi>Britannia</hi> Printed 1607. <hi>pag.</hi> 24, 25. Alſo <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringham de Gentis Anglorum Origine, pag.</hi> 99. For the Name of <hi>Brettaine</hi> is not to be found in any Author, <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine,</hi> before that time, as far forth as I have ever ſeen or heard of, <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> being the firſt among the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, and <hi>Lucretius</hi> among the <hi>Latines,</hi> who made mention thereof; and both theſe lived about the ſame Age with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or a little ſooner.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore we have no certain Hiſtory of this Iſland but from <hi>Caeſar</hi> downwards. The ancient <hi>Brettans</hi> were a barbarous People, and left no Writing or Hiſtory of their Countrey to Poſterity. <hi>Gildas,</hi> called <hi>Sapiens,</hi> is the firſt among the <hi>Brettans</hi> who hath left us any mention in Writing hereof, and thoſe very ſhort and imperfect. Now <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> writ about the Year of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 540. and what he writ (as he confeſſeth in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue) was by Relation from beyond Sea, more than out of ancient Records and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of his own Countrey: for thoſe (if any ſuch were at all) were either burned by the Enemy's rage, or carried away by the baniſhed Natives; ſo that in his time there was no ſuch extant.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Now <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> upon his ſecond Expedition into <hi>Brettaine, Anno antè Chriſtum natum</hi> 54. or thereabout, ſubdued part of <hi>Brettain,</hi> and many Cities ſubmitted, and

So <hi>Helvicus</hi> in his Chronology; alſo <hi>Bede de Hiſt. Ang. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. So that the Rule or Soveraignty of the <hi>Romans</hi> over <hi>Brettaine</hi> continued almoſt 470 Years, as <hi>Bede</hi> computeth in the ſame Chapter. But <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia, pag.</hi> 60. computing to <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Third, ſaith 476 Years.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. But now the poor <hi>Brettans,</hi> upon the <hi>Romans</hi> withdrawing of their Forces out of <hi>Brettaine,</hi> to defend themſelves, were miſerably devoured by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts:</hi> And therefore they called in, and invited the <hi>Saxons</hi> to aid them; who came firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Brettaine Anno Chriſti</hi> 449. ſaith <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Malmesbury.</hi> But the <hi>Brettans</hi> (to uſe <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s own words) perceiving the <hi>Saxons, Quaſi pro patriâ pugnaturos, ſed eam certiùs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaturos,</hi> defended themſelves as well as they could. But the <hi>Saxons,</hi> after they had expelled the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> did alſo by degrees root out the <hi>Brettans</hi> alſo; and the <hi>Saxons</hi> at laſt ſolely poſſeſſed themſelves of all the South part of <hi>Brettaine,</hi> which we now call <hi>England;</hi> but diſagreeing among themſelves, and contending for Superiority, each Party would ſet up themſelves (as it commonly falls out in ſuch Caſes,) and ſo had a <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> or ſeven diſtinct Kingdoms in <hi>England,</hi> till at laſt they were all ſwallowed up into one by that of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> the poor <hi>Brettans</hi> being driven into <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornwall.</hi>

                        <p>This was but a new Model by <hi>Egbert</hi> and <hi>Alfred:</hi> for without doubt the ancient <hi>Brettans</hi> had their Diviſions of Counties, Cities and Towns, as <hi>Cook</hi> upon <hi>Littleton</hi> well obſerves, <hi>Sect.</hi> 248.</p>

                        <p>But the Monk erreth in his Account; for there are 33 Shires named in <hi>Dooms-day</hi> Book, with <hi>Cornwall;</hi> and if <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> in <hi>Dooms-day</hi> Book have five other Shires taken out of it, and be added to the reſt, then there muſt be in all 38 Shires, and not 37. as the Monk counteth.</p>
                        <p>And if we add <hi>Rutlandſhire</hi> (which was formerly part of <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> but ſince <hi>Edward Plantagenet,</hi> Son and Heir to <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langley</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> under King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, it hath been reckoned for a County) and alſo <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> which is part of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> being now alſo put into the number of our Counties, then have we juſt 40 Counties in <hi>England</hi> at this preſent.</p>

                           <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Rothelent</hi> came very young into <hi>England</hi> with his Father, and Served King <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi> both in his Houſe and in his Wars, till at laſt the King Knighted him; afterwards, having been trained up in Arms here, he got leave of King <hi>Edward</hi> to go ſee his Friends in his own Countrey of <hi>Normandy:</hi> and after the Battel of <hi>Senlace</hi> he came again into <hi>England</hi> with his Coſin <hi>Hugh,</hi> Son of <hi>Richard de Auranches,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Goz,</hi> and was a very principal Man in all Military Employments. And after many Conflicts, the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Rothelent</hi> was the chief Commander of all the Forces under Earl <hi>Hugh,</hi> and made Governor of all <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> And <hi>William the Conquerour</hi> cauſed <hi>Rothelent</hi> Caſtle and Town to be built, and gave it to this <hi>Robert,</hi> that he might make it a Defence to <hi>England,</hi> by curbing the Excurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Welſh:</hi> And this ſtout Champion Seating on their Borders, had many Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes with the <hi>Welſh,</hi> and ſlew many of them, and enlarged his Territories; and on the Mount <hi>Dagaunoth,</hi> cloſe by the Sea, he built a ſtrong Caſtle, and for fifteen years ſore afflicted the <hi>Britons</hi> or <hi>Welſhmen.</hi> But at laſt <hi>Griffith</hi> King of <hi>Wales,</hi> on the third day of <hi>July Anno Chriſti</hi> 1088.<label type="milestone">

                           <hi>Robert</hi> had notice, he calls his Soldiers together, and with a few Soldiers coming to the top of the Hill, he ſaw them Shipping the Men and Cattel which the <hi>Welſh</hi> had taken; and being incenſed thereat, himſelf runs violently down the Steep Hill, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended onely with one Soldier, called <hi>Osberne de Orgiers,</hi> towards the Enemy; but they perceiving him ſo ſlenderly Guarded, returned back upon him, and with their Darts or Arrows mortally wounded him: yet whilſt he ſtood and had his Buckler, none durſt approach ſo near as to Encounter him with a Sword; but as ſoon as he fell, the Enemy ruſhed upon him and cut off his Head, which they hanged upon the Maſt of the Ship in triumph: Aftewards with great lamentation both of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> his Soldiers brought his Body to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and it was Interred in the Monaſtery of <hi>St. Werburge</hi> in that City: which Monaſtery <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> had built, and had made <hi>Richard,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Becke</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> the firſt Abbot thereof. Thus <hi>Ordericus, pag.</hi> 670, 671. So much of <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Rothelent;</hi> I ſhall now proceed to the the Earls of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The Title of <hi>Earl of Cheſter,</hi> ſince the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and peculiarly applied than before: for although in the time of the <hi>Saxons, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric, Algar,</hi> and <hi>Edwine,</hi> who was Earl when the <hi>Conqueror</hi> invaded <hi>England,</hi> had all of them ſucceſſively that Appellation or Title; yet they were not onely Earls of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> but were ſometimes denominated from other Places alſo, as <hi>Leofric</hi> and <hi>Algar,</hi> both many times ſtiled Earls of <hi>Leiceſter:</hi> And indeed they were not ſo much Earls of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe two Counties, as of all <hi>Mercia,</hi> whereof thoſe were but ſmall Branches or Members.</p>
                        <p>But now more particularly, the <hi>Conqueror</hi> gives to <hi>Hugh</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Lupus,</hi> the whole County and Earldom of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> to hold of him <hi>Tâm liberè ad gladium, ſicùt ipſe Rex te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebat Angliam ad Coronam,</hi> as the very words of the Charter do run, ſaith <hi>Cambden.</hi> Which words ſome Expound to be the Tenure of being Sword-bearer of <hi>England,</hi> at the Coronations of the Kings of <hi>England:</hi> whence we read in <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> that when King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third Married Queen <hi>Elinour, Anno Domini</hi> 1236. the Marriage was pompouſly ſolemnized, and all the great Men of the Kingdom uſed thoſe Offices and Places, which had of ancient Right belonged to their Anceſtors at the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings. The Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> then carried the Sword of <hi>St. Edward,</hi> which is called <hi>Curtein,</hi> before the King, in token that he was an Earl Palatine, and had Power by Right to reſtrain the King if he ſhould do amiſs, his Conſtable of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> attending on him, and beating back the People with a Rod or Staff when they preſſed diſorderly upon him. This <hi>Paris</hi> voucheth, an Author who lived in that very Age, <hi>pag.</hi> 421.</p>
                        <p>But although this Office might have of ancient Right belonged to the Earls of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> ever ſince the time of <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> yet I believe there is ſomething more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent couched in thoſe words of the firſt Charter or Donation; namely, a Dignity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the Sword, as purchaſed by it, and to be kept by it alſo: For as in the Crown of <hi>England</hi> there is an inherent Right of Regality annexed, ſo here is given an inherent Right of Dignity in the Sword. This is to hold as freely by the Sword, as the King holds by the Crown, onely inferiour to his King. Hence was it, that whatſoever we ſay concerning the Pleas of the Crown, or to be done againſt the King's Crown and Dignity, the ſame is alſo ſaid (but in a more limited courſe) concerning the Pleas of the Sword of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> or to be done againſt the Sword and Dignity of the Earl of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> as is moſt evident out of the Records and Endictments of thoſe Times.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. I come now to <hi>Hugh</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Lupus,</hi> howbeit in truth he was not the firſt Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt: for I have before ſhewed, that <hi>Gherbod,</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman of <hi>Flanders,</hi> had it firſt given to him by the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> who enjoying it but a little while, is commonly omitted without any notice at all. But this <hi>Hugh</hi> was the firſt Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> of the <hi>Norman</hi> Race ſince the <hi>Conqueſt.</hi>

                           <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1141. <hi>Anno ſexto Stephani Regis, Randle</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and <hi>William de Romara</hi> his half-Brother by the Mother, Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> rebelled againſt <hi>Stephen,</hi> and fraudulently ſurpriſed the Caſtle of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> wherein King <hi>Stephen</hi> had placed a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Soldiers for Defence of the Town; which Caſtle was taken thus. Spying the Opportunity, when the Caſtle-Soldiers were diſperſed abroad, the Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> unarmed, and without a Cloke or Coat, (as if he meant to fetch home his Wife, whom he had before ſent thither, accompanied with the Counteſs of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Wife of the ſaid <hi>William de Romara,</hi> as walking abroad for their Recreation) enters the Caſtle with three Soldiers, which followed him not far off, no Man ſuſpecting any Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They preſently ſeiſed the Port or Gate, and took all the Arms which they found, letting in <hi>William de Romara,</hi> with a Company of armed Soldiers, who haſted after, according to the contrivement of the Plot; and ſo turning all out that remained in the Caſtle, which were of the King's part, the two Brothers poſſeſſed themſelves both of the Town and Caſtle.</p>
                        <p>Biſhop <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the Townſmen, willing to inſinuate themſelves into the favor
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55739:65"/>
of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> gave him notice of what had hapned. The news much incenſed the King, and ſo much the more, by how much the Fact was committed by thoſe whom he took for his ſpecial Friends, and on whom he had conferred many Favors. <hi>Stephen</hi> forthwith gathereth an Army, and after <hi>Chriſtmas-day,</hi> which was in the ſeventh Year of <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1141. marcheth towards <hi>Lincoln;</hi> where by his ſudden and unexpected coming in the Night, and the Intelligence of ſome of the Townſmen, he ſurprized ſeventeen of the Earls Soldiers which were in the Town.</p>
                        <p>The two Earls with their Wives and Friends were Beſieged in the Caſtle, and knew not how to eſcape this preſent Danger. At laſt <hi>Randle</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> (who was the younger and more courageous Earl) adventures out by Night, attended onely with a few, and went to <hi>Cheſhire</hi> as amongſt his own Men: He makes known his Condition to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> his Father-in-law, and to others of his Friends: The Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited <hi>Welſh</hi> and many others he exaſperates againſt the King, and raiſeth all the Forces he can, to help his Friends that were Beſieged in the Caſtle of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> eſpecially he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the Aid of <hi>Maude</hi> the Empreſs and Counteſs of <hi>Anjou,</hi> ſwearing Fealty unto her, whoſe Favour he obtained. Having now gathered a numerous Army, the two Earls, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and <hi>Randle</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> march ſpeedily to <hi>Lincoln.</hi> The King hearing of their approach, adviſeth what is to be done: Some counſel him to leave a competent Strength to defend the Town, and to go away himſelf, and raiſe a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Army through all the parts of the Kingdom, whereby in due time he might be able to diſperſe them, if they ſhould continue before that Town. Others adviſe him to ſend a Parley to the Enemy, to put off the Battel, ſince that Day (being <hi>Candlemas-day</hi>) was ſacred, and to be ſet apart in commemoration of the Purification of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> But the obſtinate King not willing to delay the Matter, draws forth all his Forces im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; both Armies meet near the Town of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and being put in order, joyn Battel. The King divides his Army into three Bodies; ſo did the Earls likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Army on the contrary part. In the Front of the King's Army were the <hi>Flemmings</hi> and the <hi>Britons,</hi> Commanded by <hi>William de Ipro</hi> and <hi>Alan de Dinan.</hi> On the oppoſite part to them ſtood a furious Company of the <hi>Welſh,</hi> Commanded by two Brothers, <hi>Mariadoth</hi> and <hi>Kaladrius.</hi>

                        <p>The Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> alights from his Horſe, reſolving to Fight on foot. The ſtout Earl bravely encouraged his courageous <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Regiment of Foot, and made this ſhort Speech to the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and the reſt of his Army—</p>

                           </note> who made an Oration to encourage the Soldiers; <q>Impeaching the Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> as a Man audacious, but without Judgment; heady to plot a Treaſon, but ſtill wavering in the purſuit of it; ready to run into Battel, but uncircumſpect of any danger; aiming beyond his reach, and conceiting things meerly impoſſible; and therefore hath but few with him that know him, leading onely a Rout of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and tumultuous Peſants: So there is nothing in him to be feared; for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he begins like a Man, he ends like a Woman; unfortunate in all his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings: In his Encounters he hath either been vanquiſhed, or if by chance he rarely a obtain Victory, it is with greater loſs on his part then the Conquered.</q>

                           <hi>Randle</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> ſeeing he was thus ſuſpected, turns himſelf to his wonted courſe of Treaſon, plotting how he might more eaſily without Infamy deliver the King into the Hands of his Enemies: and coming to the Court with ſome Attendance, whereby he might be the freer from ſuſpicion, he complained how he was beſet with a barbarous multitude of <hi>Welſh,</hi> who made great ſpoil and waſte of his Lands; ſo that he and all his Tenants bordering on the Confines of his County, would be quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated, unleſs the King gave him ſpeedy Aſſiſtance; telling him, that his Preſence would do more by the very Name of a King, than many thouſands of Soldiers without him. The King cheerfully promiſeth his Aſſiſtance; but the Councel about his Royal Perſon would not ſuffer it: for they wiſhed the King to conſider, leaſt the Earl had a Deſign to enſnare him, telling him, That it was not ſafe for him to bring his Army into the midſt of ſo barbarous a Countrey, through mountainous and ſteepy places, where he might be entraped on every ſide: beſides it were a very raſh part, to go into his Countrey who had taken from him the greateſt part of his Kingdom: for although he might ſeem to incline to the King, yet there was no certainty of his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, nor Pledges of Aſſurance: And that if he would have the King's Aſſiſtance, he ſhould firſt deliver up what he had unjuſtly taken; which if he refuſed, then preſently he ſhould be ſeized on as the King's Enemy, and be impriſoned till he made Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But <hi>Randle,</hi> when he heard the Conditions which he was to perform before he could have the King's Aid, anſwer'd, That he came not to the Court for that purpoſe, neither had he any notice of this beforehand, whereby he might have adviſed thereon; and uttering many high words, he was laid hold on by the King's Officers and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned. The Nobles who took part with Earl <hi>Randle,</hi> Petitioned the King for his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, and offered Sureties, or any Security the King ſhould demand, for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up of thoſe Caſtles which were of Right belonging to the King, ſo that the Earl might be releaſed. And thereupon <hi>Randle</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> (having given Pledges, and taken a ſolemn Oath, that he would never hereafter take up Arms againſt the King) was reſtored to his Liberty.</p>
                        <p>But as ſoon as he was releaſed, he violated his Oath, and raiſed an Army againſt the King, proſecuting his wrathful indignation with revenge of Fire and Sword whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came; and, as my Author ſaith, <hi>In omnem aetatem, in omnem Sexum,</hi> Herodia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam <hi>Tyrannidem,</hi> Neronianam <hi>truculentiam exercebat.</hi> He came often with a Party of Soldiers in view of the Town of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (where now the King had placed the Flower of his Soldiery) and had many Skirmiſhes with them; ſometimes he was put to the worſe, ſometimes by the ſmiling Succeſs of Fortune he victoriouſly triumphed over the King's Party. He likewiſe blockt up the Caſtle of <hi>Coventrey,</hi> (which alſo he had delivered up to the King) till <hi>Stephen</hi> came to relieve it with Victuals, whereof it was in ſome diſtreſs; and that was done with great difficulty to the King, by forcing his Paſſage through <hi>Randle</hi>'s Army; where by the Way he had many Conflicts. In the firſt Skirmiſh the King having received ſome ſlight Wound, was forced to retreat; but as ſoon as he was recovered, he fell upon the Earls Army, took many, wounded others, and the Earl himſelf put to flight, and almoſt ſlain. The King then pulls down the Caſtle of <hi>Coventrey,</hi> which had been delivered to him before, and victoriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to other Caſtles in <hi>Randle</hi>'s poſſeſſion, ſometimes blocking them up, ſometimes burning and deſtroying all about them, and ever after became a ſore Enemy to <hi>Randle</hi> and his Adherents. Thus much <hi>ex Geſtis Stephani.</hi>

                        <p>And here I cannot paſs by <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Error in the Review of the ſecond Edition of <hi>Brooks</hi>'s Catalogue of Nobility, <hi>pag.</hi> 662. where he ſaith thus: <q>That the Barons of the Earls of <hi>Cheſter</hi> were choſen in the time of <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> I doubt: for what ſhould move <hi>Henry</hi> the Second (when he was but yet Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> and Earl of <hi>Anjou</hi>) among divers Grants that he made to <hi>Randle de Gernouns</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> to ſay in his Charter—<hi>Et ſex Baronibus ſuis, quos elegerit, cuique centum libratas terrae dabo:</hi> That he would give to the ſix Barons, <hi>quos elegerit,</hi> which he ſhall chuſe, not <hi>quos eligerit,</hi> which he hath already, choſen, a hundred pound Land apiece, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they had been choſe in <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi>'s time?</q> Thus <hi>Vincent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to paſs by his groſs Diſtinction of <hi>Elegerit</hi> and <hi>Eligerit;</hi> for it is <hi>Elegerit</hi> in both <hi>Tenſes, Future</hi> and <hi>Preterperfect Tenſe:</hi> nor is <hi>Eligerit</hi> any true <hi>Latin</hi> word at all. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he reads not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to a proper and genuine Sence; for I conceive the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be plainly thus,—<hi>Et ſex Baronibus ſuis, quos elegerit, cuique centum libratas terrae, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>To ſix of his Barons, whom he ſhall chuſe or appoint out, he will give to every one of them a hundred Pounds-worth of Land apiece.</hi> So that there might be many more Barons at that time for all this: And indeed the Charter of <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> of the Foundation of the Monaſtery of <hi>St. Werburge</hi> in <hi>Cheſter, Anno</hi> 1093. mentions Barons at that time; which you may ſee at large <hi>ſuprà, pag.</hi> 109, 110, 111. In the Subſcription whereof it is ſaid—<hi>Ego Comes Hugo &amp; Barones mei confirmavimus:</hi> And I pray you, how comes the Duke here to know <hi>Randle</hi>'s mind to elect Barons, if they were yet to be choſen?</p>
                        <p>But where he renders it—<hi>And to the ſix Barons which he ſhall chuſe,</hi> I ſhould render it, <hi>And to ſix of his Barons whom he ſhall chuſe, or cull out:</hi> For the Grant being made to Earl <hi>Randle,</hi> there was ſo much to be given to ſix of his Barons, but left to the appointment and nomination of Earl <hi>Randle,</hi> which ſix Barons he would have to be the Men to enjoy thoſe Lands: for if we ſhould render it—<hi>And to his ſix Barons, &amp;c.</hi> implying onely
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55739:68"/>
that ſet number, and no more, the following words <hi>(quos elegerit)</hi> would be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for being given to ſix Barons equally, there is no choice left at all to the Earl, where there be no more Barons: unleſs we ſuppoſe ſix Barons to be made, and that there were none before; which evidently appears to the contrary: Therefore indeed theſe words, rightly underſtood, do imply, there were more Barons at that time, out of which <hi>Randle</hi> had the nomination of the ſix here intended left unto him.</p>
                        <p>But of theſe Barons I ſhall ſpeak more particularly in the third Part of this Book.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Amicia,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Raufe Manwaring,</hi> ſometime Judge of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> to whom <hi>Hugh Cyveliok</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> her Father, gave in <hi>libero maritagio ſervitium Willielmi Filii Rogeri: ſcilicèt ſervitium trium militum; faciendo ſibi ſervitium duorum militum,</hi> as the words of the original Deed do run, now in the poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>Thomas Manwaring</hi> of <hi>Over Pever,</hi> Baronet.</p>
                           <p>Alſo another baſe Daughter, as I conceive, Married one <hi>Bacun,</hi> and had Iſſue <hi>Richard Bacun,</hi> Founder of the Priory of <hi>Rouceſter</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> about the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> for the ſafety of his Soul, and the Soul of his Uncle, <hi>Randle</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter. Monaſticon, Part</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 267.</p>
                           <p>And here I cannot but miſlike the boldneſs and ignorance of that Herald, who gave to <hi>Manwaring</hi> of <hi>Pever</hi> the Quartering of the Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi>'s Coat of Arms: which Device was never done before the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the time of Sir <hi>Randle Manwaring,</hi> late of <hi>Pever,</hi> the elder, my Grandfather by the Mother: for if he ought of right to Quarter that Coat, then muſt he be Deſcended from a Coheir to the Earl of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> but that he was not: for the Coheirs of Earl <hi>Hugh,</hi> as you ſee before, were Married to four of the greateſt Peers of the Kingdom, the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>'s Son and Heir, who lived not to be Earl: Neither was <hi>Manwaring</hi> then an equal Competitor, to have Married a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir to the Earl of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> And it is plain, <hi>ex placitis</hi> 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>Rot.</hi> 14. in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where the Coheirs Implead <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> for their part, there is no mention of <hi>Amice</hi> claiming any part, or any from or under her, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Beſides, all ancient Authors of thoſe Times, as <hi>Polychronicon, Matthew Paris, Knighton, Stowe,</hi> and others, would not have omitted her among the reſt which they have ſet down, had ſhe been a Coheir; which alſo ſhe muſt needs have been, had ſhe been legitimate: for <hi>Hugh Cyvelioc</hi> never had any other Wife but <hi>Bertred,</hi> and ſhe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived him.</p>
                           <p>And though <hi>Amice</hi> in the Deed before mentioned is ſtiled—<hi>Filia Hugonis Comitis,</hi> without the addition or note of Baſtard, it was very uſual in thoſe elder Ages ſo to do. The like we find of <hi>Geva,</hi> baſe Daughter of <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. Concerning this <hi>Bertred,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Hugh Cyveliok,</hi> I cannot omit the Falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Abſurdities of ſome Authors, as <hi>Powel</hi> on the <hi>Welſh</hi> Hiſtory, <hi>pag.</hi> 295. and <hi>Ferne</hi> in his <hi>Lacy's Nobility, pag.</hi> 53. both of them calling this <hi>Bertred</hi> by the Name of <hi>Beatrix,</hi> and ſaying ſhe was the Daughter of <hi>Richard Lucy,</hi> Chief Juſtice of <hi>England;</hi> a moſt groſs Falſity. I am very certain that <hi>Hugh Cyvelioc</hi>'s Wife was not Daughter of <hi>Lucy,</hi> nor ever called <hi>Beatrix</hi> in any old Deed or Record; though I find by good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that there was a Woman called <hi>Beatrix Lucy,</hi> but never Wife of Earl <hi>Hugh.</hi>

                           <p>Wherein <hi>Geva</hi> is called Daughter of Earl <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> as <hi>Amice</hi> in that other Deed is termed Daughter of Earl <hi>Hugh Cyveliok.</hi> Now that <hi>Geva</hi> was a Baſtard, is very plain out of <hi>Ordericus,</hi> a Man that lived in that very Age: He tells us, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 787. ſpeaking of <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> his Death—<hi>Ricardus pulcherrimus puer quem ſolùm ex Ermentrude Filia Hugonis de Claro-monte genuit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Richard,</hi> a brave Youth, whom onely <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> begot on <hi>Ermentrude,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Hugh de Claremonte,</hi> &amp;c. Nor can this be reſtrained to the onely Son, for then it muſt have been otherwiſe expreſſed: And if <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> had any other Son or Daughter by <hi>Ermentrude,</hi> then cannot <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> be ſaid onely to be begotten on her by Earl <hi>Hugh;</hi> and ſo <hi>Geva</hi> was a Baſtard, or elſe <hi>Ordericus</hi> lyes. Alſo the ſame Author tells us, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 522. that <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> had alſo many baſe Sons and Daughters by ſeveral Strumpets, who were almoſt all ſwept away by ſundry Misfortunes; and very probably, if <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> had any more legitimate Children by his Wife beſides Earl <hi>Richard,</hi> either Son or Daughter, <hi>Ordericus</hi> would have Recorded them as well as he hath put down others in like nature, being indeed his uſual method through the whole courſe of his Hiſtory: And had <hi>Geva</hi> been legitimate, then her Iſſue ought rather to have ſucceeded into the Earldom of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> than <hi>Randle de Meſchines,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> foraſmuch as the Siſter and her Heirs ought to Inherit before the Aunt and her Heirs: And howbeit many Earldoms have Deſcended to the Heirs Males, and not to the Heirs general; yet in this Caſe were no Heirs Male, but two Females, an Aunt legitimate, who had it, and a Siſter not legitimate: And ſhew me a Precedent whereever the Heirs of an Aunt Inherited before the Heirs of a Siſter, both legally born, and no Heirs Male left, unleſs in caſe of Forfeiture by Treaſon, or ſome other great Cauſe to hinder the ſame.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, add to theſe the words of <hi>Glanvill,</hi> Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> who lived under <hi>Hen.</hi> II. in that very Age with <hi>Amice, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Quilibet liber Homo quandam partem terrae ſuae cum Filiâ ſuâ, vel cum aliquâ aliâ quâlibet muliere, dare poteſt in marita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium, ſive habuerit haeredem ſive non, velit haeres vel non, imo &amp; eo contradicente:</hi> And if a Man might give Land then in Free Marriage with any Woman whatſoever, then he might give it to his Baſtard; and then the Law is now changed: for now it muſt be of the Donors Blood; and a Baſtard is now ſaid not to be of the Donors Blood <hi>quaſi nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius filius.</hi> And it ſeems to me, that in thoſe elder Ages Baſtards were reputed of the Blood, by the frequent Appellation of them by the Names of Uncle, Brother, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Son, and Coſin. Beſides, our Laws were then imperfect, dark, and obſcure in moſt things, till <hi>Bracton</hi> under King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third compiled the Body of our Laws, and brought them into a Method.</p>
                           <p>And now I have done concerning this chief Reaſon, whereupon thoſe worthy Judges grounded their Opinions; and we daily ſee Opinions of Lawyers follow the putting of the Caſe, which many times upon mature deliberation, and hearing of the Caſe well argued; may then be of another Opinion.</p>
                           <p>Now follow the Arguments of leſſer moment, which I perſwade my ſelf were no Grounds for the Judges aforeſaid.</p>
                           <p n="2">II <hi>The diſparity of the Years between</hi> Hugh Cyveliok <hi>and</hi> Bertred <hi>his Wife, may ſuppoſe he had a former Wife; for</hi> Bertred <hi>was but</hi> 26 <hi>Years old at the Death of Earl</hi> Hugh 1181, <hi>as appears by the Inquiſition taken</hi> 30 Hen. 2. 1183. <hi>after the Death of</hi> Hugh Cyveliok, <hi>and</hi> Hugh <hi>was Earl of</hi> Cheſter 28 <hi>Years, which was one or two Years before</hi> Bertred <hi>was horn, beſides what Years were run up of his Age before his Father</hi> Randle <hi>died, which may be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55739:72"/>
ſuppoſed to be a competent term of Years; and then it is probable he had a former Wife, and that he ſtayed not unmarried ſo long as till</hi> Bertred <hi>was fit for Marriage.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now let us examine the Matter a little, it will give us ſome light: <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> Married <hi>Mabill,</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>Robert Fitz-Haimon, Anno Domini</hi> 1110. So <hi>Stowe</hi> in his Chronicle. See alſo <hi>Seldin</hi>'s <hi>Tit. Hon. pag.</hi> 647. By her he had Iſſue four Sons and two Daughters. <hi>Maude</hi> the younger Daughter Married <hi>Randle de Gernoniis</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> Father to <hi>Hugh Cyveliok. Vincent</hi> upon <hi>Brook, pag.</hi> 216. Now ſuppoſe we <hi>Maude</hi> to be the fourth Child: probably ſhe was not born till about the Year 1117. or thereabout, and that about the Year 1139. ſhe was Married to Earl <hi>Randle,</hi> whereby <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> ſtrengthned his Party for <hi>Maude</hi> the Empreſs. At that time ſhe cannot well be ſuppoſed to be above 22 Years old, if ſhe were ſo much. Now Earl <hi>Randle</hi> died 1153. So that <hi>Hugh Cyveliok</hi> could not poſſibly be above twelve Years old at his Father's Death; he might be much leſs: but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we in a middle way, that he was ſix Years old at his Father's Death, which is more than can be well affirmed, then could not Earl <hi>Hugh</hi> be above ſeven or eight Years older than <hi>Bertred</hi> his Wife: and what great matter is this? I my ſelf was eight years older than my Wife when I was Married; but it is much more probable that he never had any other Wife, becauſe he had many Baſtard Sons and Daughters, whoſe heat of Youth might by a very timely Marriage have been poſſibly prevented, or at leaſt aſſwaged in ſome meaſure.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. Bertred, <hi>the Wife of</hi> Hugh Cyveliok <hi>was a Witneſs to the Deed in Frank-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with</hi> Amice; <hi>and</hi> Amice <hi>had a Daughter called</hi> Bertred, <hi>after the Name of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs,</hi> ergo <hi>probably</hi> Amice <hi>was no Baſtard.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> Truly this is of ſo little weight, that it will need no Anſwer; for I yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend no Reaſon in it.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. Roger Manwaring, <hi>Son of</hi> Raufe Manwaring, <hi>calls</hi> Randle Blundevill <hi>Earl of</hi> Cheſter <hi>and</hi> Lincoln, <hi>his Uncle in another Deed; wherefore it is to be ſuppoſed that</hi> Amice <hi>was no Baſtard, otherwiſe</hi> Roger <hi>durſt not have preſumed to have called the Earl Uncle.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hiſtories, Deeds, and Records, are full of Examples in this nature, where we find Baſtards frequently called Coſin, Brother, Uncle, Son, and Daughter: for example, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> baſe Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, is frequently called in Hiſtories, Brother to <hi>Maude</hi> the Empreſs. <hi>Hoveden, pag.</hi> 553.

                           <head>The Reaſons that <hi>Amice</hi> was a Baſtard.</head>
                           <p n="1">I. IF <hi>Hugh Cyveliok</hi> had no other Wife but <hi>Bertred,</hi> then <hi>Amice</hi> muſt certainly be a Baſtard; for ſhe was not a Daughter by <hi>Bertred,</hi> as is granted on all ſides.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Hugh Cyveliok</hi> never had any other Wife but <hi>Bertred;</hi> Ergo <hi>Amice</hi> was a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard.</p>
                           <p>Now the <hi>Minor</hi> is to be proved by the Affirmer, <hi>Oportet affirmantem probare:</hi> for as yet I never ſaw the leaſt proof thereof, either by Deed, Record, or any ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, nor yet any inducement of good Reaſon to incline my belief of it: And till this be done, it is unreaſonable to impoſe it upon any Man's Belief, by ſuppoſing that he had another Wife: for Suppoſitions are no proof at all. It is not enough to ſuppoſe <hi>Amice</hi> might be by a former Wife, but it muſt be clearly proved, or ſtrongly inferred from ſolid Reaſon, that it is ſo, and that <hi>Hugh</hi> had a former Wife.</p>
                           <p>Neither is it a ſufficient Anſwer hereunto to ſay, That it is unreaſonable to conclude all Children Baſtards, whoſe Mothers cannot be proved; God forbid. But in this Caſe we find a Wife certainly Recorded, and a Son and four Daughters (who were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Coheirs, and carried away all Earl <hi>Hugh</hi>'s Lands) clearly proved by Records and ancient Hiſtorians. And alſo Earl <hi>Hugh</hi> is certainly known to have had many Baſtards, both Sons and Daughters; which gives occaſion of ſtrong ſuſpicion, that <hi>Amice</hi> was a Baſtard, ſhe being neither Recorded by any Hiſtorian, nor ever had or claimed any Land as a Coheir; and therefore here is a neceſſity of proving a former Wife, which for my part I believe firmly Earl <hi>Hugh</hi> never had.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. Whatſoever is given in Frank-Marriage, is given as a Portion: now the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of the Service of one Knights Fee in Frank-Marriage, ſeems not a competent Portion for a legitimate Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> eſpecially for the eldeſt Daughter: for ſo ſhe muſt be, being of the firſt <hi>Venter,</hi> which always is more worthy than the ſecond, if ſhe were at all legitimate; and we find the other Daughters Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to four of the greateſt Earls in <hi>England:</hi> all which is a ſtrong preſumption that <hi>Amice</hi> was a Baſtard, and no legitimate Daughter.</p>
                           <p>To this it may be anſwered, <hi>That poſſibly Earl</hi> Hugh <hi>might give</hi> Amice <hi>a great Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Money, though ſhe had no Lands.</hi> And I ſay poſſibly too, he might give her no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or at leaſt nothing conſiderable; which great Portion in Money, when it ſhall appear to be true, may take off the ſtrength of this Argument or ſecond Reaſon, till then it muſt be very preſſing.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. The ancient Hiſtorians of our Nation, as <hi>Polychronicon,</hi> writ by the Monk of <hi>Cheſter, Henry Knighton,</hi> the Monk of <hi>Leyceſter,</hi> and others; alſo <hi>Stowe</hi> and <hi>Cambden</hi> have Recorded the lawful Daughters and Coheirs of Earl <hi>Hugh,</hi> and ſo the Record of 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. And had <hi>Amice</hi> been a legitimate Daughter, it is likely that theſe Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians would not all have omitted her; but of her there is <hi>Altum ſilentium</hi> among all the Hiſtorians and Records which I have yet ſeen; though indeed I look upon this onely as a probable, not as a ſure evincing Argument.</p>
                           <p>Theſe were the Reaſons which inclined my Opinion to place <hi>Amice</hi> in that Order as I have done: But ſince there are ſome Learned Men of another Opinion, I muſt leave every Perſon to the dictate of his own Reaſon.</p>

                           <hi>Anno</hi> 1229. the King having gathered a great Army together at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> thought to Tranſport them beyond Sea, to recover thoſe Lands which his Father had loſt; but not finding ſufficient Shipping for half his Army, he imputed the fault to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of <hi>Hubert de Burgo,</hi> that he ſhould have been Bribed thereunto by the Queen of <hi>France;</hi> and drawing his Sword to have killed <hi>Hubert, Randle</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> interpoſed and ſaved him, that he got out of the King's ſight till his fury was paſt. <hi>Paris, pag.</hi> 363.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Spelman</hi> in his <hi>Gloſſary</hi> deriveth the word <hi>Baro</hi> from the old <hi>Engliſh-Saxon Per</hi> or <hi>Wer,</hi> and of later Times written <hi>Par; Francis Antiquis, Ber,</hi> ſignifying the ſame with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> word <hi>Vir; Gloſſarium Latino-Gallicum, Ber, Bara, Vir;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>Vir</hi> ſeems to be the original Fountain whence it ſprings. And both theſe words <hi>Baro,</hi> by ſome written <hi>Varo,</hi> and <hi>Vir,</hi> do agree in their ſeveral ſignifications; ſometimes for a Man barely and abſolutely; ſometimes for a Man of Worth, Power, or Proweſs; ſometimes for a Husband.</p>
                        <p>For the notion of the word here, it denotes as much as <hi>Magnates</hi> or <hi>Optimates:</hi> where we may obſerve, That Noblemen, or Barons, ſeem to be a neceſſary Supplement, as eſſential to the Royalty of a Count Palatine: for the Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> having Royal Authority within himſelf, we may not unfitly ſtile him a petty King: And that the Majeſty of his Palace may be anſwerable to a King, he muſt have Noblemen about him, in imitation of the Barons of the Kingdom. Hence alſo the Earls of <hi>Cheſter</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Offices, making the Baron of <hi>Halton</hi> Conſtable in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> in Fee, in imitation of the Lord High-Conſtable of <hi>England;</hi> and making the Baron of <hi>Montalt</hi> Steward of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> in Fee, after the example of the Lord High-Steward of <hi>England.</hi> Theſe Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons under the Earl Ruled and Governed the County; and from their great Power and Sway, had the Appellation of Barons.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. As to the time of their firſt Inſtitution, I find the Great Men of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> about
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55739:84"/>
the Earl, ſtiled <hi>Barons</hi> in the time of <hi>Hugh Lupus:</hi> In the Charter of his Foundation of the Monaſtery of <hi>St. Werburge</hi> in <hi>Cheſter, Anno</hi> 1093. 6 <hi>Willielmi Rufi,</hi> in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof it is ſaid,—<hi>Ego Comes Hugo &amp; mei Barones confirmavimus iſta omnia coràm Anſelmo Archiepiſcopo, &amp;c.</hi> Neither muſt we fondly imagine or expect any formal Creation of them, either by Patent (for ſuch are of later Times by much,) or any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Inveſture. But (as I conceive) upon the conferring of the Earldom of <hi>Cheſter</hi> on <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> by the <hi>Conqueror, Anno Domini</hi> 1070. the principal Gentlemen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders under Earl <hi>Hugh,</hi> being called to adviſe and aſſiſt the ſaid Earl (either in any time of imminent danger, or in regulating and ordering the more weighty Affairs of the County) were of courſe ſo ſtiled: and thus I conceive they retained the Name of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> by little and little, after the manner of the Great Nobles of the Realm.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And hence may we gueſſe their Office, <hi>Adeſſe Comiti in Concilio,</hi> as <hi>Cambden</hi> hath it, to aſſiſt the Earl in Council upon all grand Deſigns and Affairs.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Concerning their Place of Precedence and Dignity, we muſt conſider them either in relation to others, or among themſelves.</p>
                        <p>In relation to others out of the County, I conceive them inferior to the rank of the Barons of our Realm; for theſe are but titularly or analogically Barons (as I may ſo ſpeak) to thoſe of the Kingdom; nay, in Place beneath all Knights: but they were the greateſt Men in the County under the Earl for Power and Eſtate.</p>
                        <p>Their Priority or Dignity among themſelves we ſhall trace as exactly as we can, in ſo remote and obſcure a Path. Some would have the Baron of <hi>Malpas</hi> to be the prime Baron, foraſmuch as <hi>Robert Fitz-Hugh</hi> (who was Baron of <hi>Malpas</hi> under <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> in the <hi>Conqueror</hi>'s time) hath for the moſt part the preeminence in the Subſcription of old Charts of thoſe ancient Times, as alſo in the Record of <hi>Dooms-day</hi> Book, where among all the reſt of the Barons he is put down firſt next after the Earl; and by which it appears alſo that he held more Land in this County than any one of the reſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>William Malbedenge.</hi> But this Difficulty is eaſily removed, if we conſider the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Subſcription of Witneſſes; but eſpecially admitting him to be the prime Baron, till certain Offices were annexed to other Barons: After which time the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is without controverſie; for <hi>William Fitz-Nigell,</hi> Baron of <hi>Halton,</hi> being made Conſtable of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> in Fee, carries it clear by his Office annexed to his Barony. And for further ſatisfaction take this Charter, remaining in one of the <hi>Couchir</hi> Books in the <hi>Dutchy-Office</hi> at <hi>Gray's-Inne, London; Scilicèt Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Comitatus Ceſtriae, num.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 41. which Deed was made in the Reign of King <hi>Stephen</hi> by <hi>Randle</hi> the Second, ſirnamed <hi>Gernouns,</hi> to <hi>Euſtace Fitz-John,</hi> who Married the elder Daughter and Coheir to <hi>William Fitz-Nigell:</hi> for William the younger died without Iſſue.</p>

                        <p>And if any ask me what other Barons were in the time of <hi>Hugh Lupus?</hi> I anſwer: <hi>Robert of Rothelent</hi> was one of Earl <hi>Hugh</hi>'s Barons, and not the meaneſt; for he was the principal Commander of all the Forces in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and the prime Governour of the County under Earl <hi>Hugh</hi> his Coſin. <hi>Ordericus, pag.</hi> 670. But we find no mention of his Poſterity in ſucceeding Ages among us, and therefore not reckoned as a Baron among thoſe, whoſe Heirs and Poſterity have by long continuance obtained the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Honour, as it were hereditarily, under the ſucceſſive Earls: And the like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be ſaid of ſome others.</p>
                        <p>Neither muſt I here forget a touch of <hi>Vincent</hi> (whoſe Corrections need a Corrector) in his <hi>Review</hi> of <hi>York</hi>'s ſecond Edition, <hi>pag.</hi> 661, 662, where he ſaith, <hi>That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Barons of</hi> Cheſhire <hi>are not ſo ancient as the time of</hi> Hugh Lupus. But whether he believe it or no, it is moſt certain they were ſtiled Barons in the Charter of <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> of the Foundation of the Monaſtery of <hi>St. Werburge</hi> in <hi>Cheſter, Anno</hi> 1093. which Charter I have at large tranſcribed above in the ſecond Part of this Book.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. As to the Baron of <hi>Stockport,</hi> mentioned in the laſt place by <hi>Spelman,</hi> it is much to be doubted whether he were any of the ancient Barons to the Earls of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> howbeit his Arms are put up in the Exchequer at <hi>Cheſter</hi> among the Barons: but all thoſe Arms were but of late times put up there, and where the Baron of <hi>Monte-alto</hi> is moſt unjuſtly placed above the Baron of <hi>Halton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is certain, that in <hi>Dooms-day</hi> Book we find not any Perſon that held <hi>Stockport;</hi> whereby it may ſeem then to be waſte and not inhabited. And as concerning Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard de Stockport</hi> and his Family, we find little or no mention before the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, in which King's Reign the ancient Earls of <hi>Cheſter</hi> were extinct: So that the Family of <hi>Stockport</hi> could be none of the ancient Barons.</p>

                        <p>IN ancient time there were but two Eſcheators in <hi>England,</hi> the one on this ſide of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the other beyond <hi>Trent;</hi> at which time they had Sub-Eſchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: But in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second the Offices were divided, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Eſcheators made in every County for Life, &amp;c. and ſo continued till the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. And afterwards by the Statute of 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. it was Enacted, that there ſhould be as many Eſcheators aſſigned, as when <hi>Edward</hi> the Third came to the Crown, and that was one in every County, and that no Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheator ſhould tarry in his Office above a year: and by another Statute, to be in Office but once in three years: The Lord-Treaſurer nameth him. <hi>Cook upon Littleton, fol.</hi> 13. <hi>b.</hi>

Theſe were ordained for the better ſuppreſſing of Robberies: for every free born Man was now to be ranked, or put into ſome Hundred and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and if there were any Perſon of ſuch diſſolute Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that he could find no Pledge or Surety in the Hundred and Tything for his good Demeanour, he was to be Impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as a Man unworthy to be at liberty. And if any Perſon guilty of a Robbery (whether before ſuch Pledge found, or after) ſhould flie and make an eſcape, all the Inhabitants of the Hundred and Tything were to be Amerced by the King: So that by this means there was ſuch a Calm of Peace in the Nation in a ſhort ſpace, that if any Man had left Bracelets of Gold, or Bags of Money in the High-way, there was none durſt take them away, as both <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and <hi>Ingulphus</hi> do inform us.</p>

                        <p>And as <hi>Speed</hi> calls our County-Palatine of <hi>Cheſter, The Seedplot of Gentility,</hi> and Learned <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia</hi> ſtiles it, <hi>The moſt ſurpaſſing Nurſery of ancient Gentry above any other County in England,</hi> ſo I may not unfitly call this Hundred of <hi>Bucklow, The prime Border of that Nurſery,</hi> as having a more numerous company of Gentry therein, proportionably to its compaſs, above any other Hundred in our County.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Churches and Chappels of this Hundred, I ſhall add what I can gather concerning them in thoſe particular Towns where I find them ſituated; and my Authorities, as well for theſe as all the reſt of this Fourth Part of my Book, ſhall either be put down <hi>verbatim</hi> (where it is moſt neceſſary, and of moſt concern) or elſe be referred unto, and in whoſe Hands the Original remaineth.</p>

                           <p>Concerning the Churches and Chappels of <hi>Bucklow</hi> Hundred, I ſhall ſpeak more particularly in their due place and order, as within the compaſs of my intended Task; onely we may take notice here, that Pariſhes were firſt diſtinguiſhed in <hi>England</hi> under <hi>Honorius</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> about the Year of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 636. <hi>Cambden's Britannia</hi> Printed 1607. <hi>pag.</hi> 116. <hi>Parker</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtoria Cantuarienſis, pag.</hi> 52.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ridley,</hi> in his <hi>View of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Law,</hi> tells us, <hi>pa.</hi> 176, 177. that Fonts in the Primitive Times, were not in the Churches; but the Cuſtom of thoſe elder Ages, was to Baptize in Rivers and Fountains; and that Cuſtom being diſcontinued through Perſecution, Fonts were erected in private Houſes; and in more peaceable Ages they made bold to build their Fonts a little diſtance from the Church: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they obtained to ſet them in the Church Porch; at laſt they got them into the Church: But they were not at firſt placed in every Church immediately; for at the firſt they were found onely in the Cathedral Church where the Biſhop reſided: and though Service might be ſaid in the leſſer Minſters and Rural Churches, yet the Right of Sepulture and Baptiſm belonged to the Cathedral Church, unleſs it were in caſe of neceſſity; and it was therefore called <hi>The Mother-Church,</hi> becauſe as People in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb were born Men, ſo in the Fonts of Baptiſm, as in the Churches Womb, they were born <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> In ſucceeding Ages, when it was found that the Mother-Church was too far diſtant from ſome Villages, and ſo ſituated, that in the Winter the People could not repair thither, conſideration was had of this Inconvenience, and the Biſhop took occaſion hence to transfer the Rite of Baptiſm and Sepulture to the Rural Churches, and this, together with the Rite of Tythes, made it a Pariſh Church of that kind which we now have. But becauſe alſo in many Pariſhes ſome Families lived ſo remote from the Church, that they could not conveniently frequent the ſame, it was indulged to ſuch, that they might build a private Oratory in or near their Manſion-places, reſerving for the moſt part the Rite of Baptiſm and Sepulture to the Pariſh Church, which, in reſpect of theſe leſſer Oratories, was to be accounted the Baptiſmal or Mother-Church. It was alſo provided, that theſe Families (notwithſtanding their Grant from the Biſhop for a private Oratory) ſhould upon more ſolemn Feaſt-days, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to their Pariſh Church, as it ſeems by the Council held at <hi>Agatha.</hi> Theſe private Oratories were afterwards called <hi>Capellae,</hi> Chappels; and thoſe that did Exerciſe in them the Miniſterial Function, were called <hi>Capellani, Chaplains.</hi> Thus <hi>Ridley.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now the word <hi>Capella, quaſi Capſella,</hi> is a Diminutive from <hi>Capſa,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Cheſt</hi> or <hi>Coffer,</hi> becauſe the Relicks of Saints or holy Perſons were kept in ſuch a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55739:103"/>
Cheſt; and the place, where ſuch Cheſt was kept, was ſo called alſo; <hi>undè Nomen Capella, Capellanus,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Spelman</hi> in his Gloſſary upon that word.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Beatus Rhenanus,</hi> with <hi>Durand,</hi> do derive the word <hi>Capella</hi> from <hi>Capa</hi> or <hi>Cappa, St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s Hood being ſo called barbarouſly, and carried about for good luck by <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King in all his Wars. But others derive it <hi>à Pellibus Caprarum,</hi> wherewith ſuch portable Tents for God's Service, as were to be removed in their warlike Expeditions, were covered. Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> in his Conſecration Sermon of <hi>Exceſter</hi> Colledge Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in <hi>Oxford, pag.</hi> 26.</p>
                           <p>None might of right build Oratories without Licence from the Biſhop, at leaſt none might Adminiſter Divine Service there without the Biſhop's ſpecial Licence.</p>
                           <p>Oratories erected in the Houſes of Great Perſons, for the uſe of a private Family, I call ſuch <hi>Domeſtick Chappels.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>When built by one, or ſeveral Perſons, in ſome convenient place, for the uſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Families, or of a Townſhip or Townſhips, not having liberty of Baptiſm or Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, I call ſuch <hi>Chappels of Eaſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>When built by a more numerous multitude of the Neighborhood, conſiſting of one or more Villages, having got liberty for Baptiſm and Burial, with Conſecration thereof by the Biſhop, and ſometimes an Allowance in Money or Tythes from the Mother-Church, I call ſuch <hi>Parochial Chappels:</hi> for theſe have all the Rites and Ceremonies as the Mother-Church or Pariſh Church hath, except the Tythes; ſo that indeed they are as leſſer Pariſhes created within the greater for the benefit of the Neighborhood.</p>
                           <p>As to the Conſecration of Churches, we find the <hi>Jews</hi> had their <hi>Encaenia,</hi> or Feaſts of Dedication of their Temple, <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 22.1 <hi>Maccabaeorum, cap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 59.</p>
                           <p>But there was no Dedication of our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches to Saints, until Praying to Saints was in uſe; and after Churches began to be Dedicated to Saints, their Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Feaſts were uſually kept on that Day, which was the Feaſt-day appointed in the <hi>Kalendar</hi> for commemoration of that Saint, to whom ſuch Church was particularly Dedicated. This time was called with us, <hi>The Wakes,</hi> from Waking, as the <hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>Vigiliae, à vigilando,</hi> becauſe at ſuch times the People Prayed moſt of the Night before ſuch Feaſt-day in the Churches. And though the Primitive Cuſtom herein was ſacred, yet how it was abuſed in the Reign of King <hi>Edgar, Anno Domini</hi> 967. <hi>aut circi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tèr,</hi> appears by the Canons of the Church in his Reign, <hi>Num.</hi> 28.—<hi>Docemus, ut in Eccleſiarum Encaeniis unusquiſque ſe modeſtum exhibeat, &amp; orationi incumbat diligentèr, non poculis, non luxui deditus. Spelman</hi>'s <hi>Councils, Pars</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 451. And at laſt it turned to Feaſting and Merriment of Neighbors.</p>
                           <p>Now Invocation of Saints for three hundred years after <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be found among any of the Fathers: None did teach Invocation of Saints, till by Rhetorical Expreſſions, and Poetical Fancies, like Invocating of the Muſes, <hi>Baſil, Nyſſen,</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen</hi> had led the way.

                           <hi>In a Rentall of</hi> Dunham-Maſſy, <hi>dated 3</hi> Hen. <hi>4. 1402. I find there were about forty Freeholders or Charterers in</hi> Altrincham, <hi>the reſt of the Tenants of</hi> Altrincham, <hi>then not above eighteen in number, were Tenants at Will. And it appears by that Rentall, as well as by another of my own in</hi> Henry <hi>the Seventh's time, that in thoſe Ages till</hi> Hen. <hi>8. the ancient Tenants in our County had generally no Leaſes for Lives, as now they have: and the Rents which at this day we call</hi> Old Rents, <hi>were in thoſe former Ages the utmoſt value of ſuch Tenements on the Rack, ſo much have theſe late Ages outſtripped the former for value, as well for Land as other Commodities.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>At this day, 1669. there are above twenty Charterers in this Town, whereof</hi> Robert Parker <hi>'s of</hi> Oldfield-Hall <hi>in</hi> Altrincham <hi>Gentleman is of greateſt value, next to which is that belonging to</hi> William Leyceſter <hi>of</hi> Hale-Lowe <hi>Gentleman. Moſt of all the reſt are very ſmall Parcels, not worth the reckoning up; the chief Lord being</hi> George Booth <hi>of</hi> Dunham-Maſſy, <hi>Lord</hi> Delamere.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>There are ſo very many ſmall Cottages erected here by the permiſſion of the Lords of</hi> Dunham-Maſſy, <hi>that it is now become a Neſt of Beggars.</hi>

                        <p>About the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, I find one <hi>Gilbert de Aſton</hi> certainly poſſeſſed of this Town of <hi>Aſton juxta Sutton:</hi> In which Line and Family it hath continued ever ſince to this day, Sir <hi>Willoughby Aſton</hi> of <hi>Aſton</hi> Baronet being now Owner of the ſame, who hath built a ſumptuous Houſe here a little diſtance from the old one, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1668.</p>

                        <p>Here was anciently a Chappel called <hi>Middleton-Chappel,</hi> where the Prior and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of <hi>Norton</hi> were bound to find a Prieſt, in former Ages, to ſay Maſs on <hi>Sundays, Wedneſdays,</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> Weekly, for ever: Which Chappel being out of Repair, and Service ſaid there onely on <hi>Sundays</hi> for forty Years then laſt paſt, it was complained of by <hi>Richard Aston,</hi> Son of Sir <hi>Robert Aston,</hi> at a Viſitation 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 1425. and an Order was made by <hi>Richard Stanley</hi> then Arch-Deacon of <hi>Chester,</hi> the twentieth of <hi>August,</hi> 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. That whereas the Prior and Convent of <hi>Norton,</hi> long before the ſame was an Abbey, did Covenant with the Abbot of <hi>Vale-Royal,</hi> to find at their own proper Coſt a fit Chaplain to Officiate here three days a week, as aforeſaid; It was ordered, That the ſaid Agreement ſhould be kept and obſerved. But theſe Variances concerning <hi>Middleton</hi>-Chappel, between <hi>Robert</hi> Abbot of the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Norton,</hi> and <hi>Richard Aston</hi> of <hi>Aston</hi> Eſquire, were compoſed by the mediation of <hi>Thomas Dutton</hi> Eſquire, and <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife, Dame <hi>Iſabel</hi> late Wife of Sir <hi>John Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi> and <hi>Jenkin</hi> of <hi>Leycester:</hi> Dated the tenth of <hi>November,</hi> 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.

                        <p>But after that <hi>Middleton</hi>-Chappel fell into decay, another Chappel was erected in later Ages, ſomewhat nearer to the Hall of <hi>Aston,</hi> called <hi>Aston-Chappel,</hi> ſituate within the Pariſh of <hi>Runcorne;</hi> and in lieu of finding a Prieſt to Officiate here by the Abbot of <hi>Norton,</hi> the King (after thoſe Lands came into his Hands) gave five Pounds yearly Rent to the Maintenance of a Miniſter here at <hi>Aston-Chappel,</hi> iſſuing out of the Lands late belonging to <hi>Norton</hi>-Abby, by a Decree in the Court of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations at <hi>London,</hi> dated the 28 of <hi>January,</hi> 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.

                        <p>In the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's Reign, <hi>Geffrey</hi> Son of <hi>Adam de Dutton</hi> was poſſeſſed of this Town (lineal Anceſtor to <hi>Warburton</hi> of <hi>Arley,</hi> whoſe Poſterity under <hi>Edward</hi> the Second aſſumed the Sir-name of <hi>Warburton,</hi> from the Place of their Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at that time.)

                           <hi>Geffrey</hi> Son of <hi>Adam de Dutton</hi> above-mentioned (as I find in a Parchment Roll among the Evidences of <hi>Dutton</hi>) gave away the third part of this <hi>Budworth</hi> unto the Priory of <hi>Norton,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, to pray for his Soul for evermore: But after the Diſſolution of Abbies by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, King <hi>Henry</hi> ſold all the Lands in <hi>Great Budworth</hi> and <hi>Comberbache,</hi> which belonged to the late Priory of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> unto <hi>John Grimſdich</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Gentleman: The Charter under the Broad Seal is dated at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> 1 <hi>die Julii,</hi> 36 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 1544.</p>

                           <pb n="227" facs="tcp:55739:117"/>Juſt over the ſame Steeple-door, under the great Window, I find three Coats of Arms, (but are not of ſuch Antiquity as the other engraved Words before-mentioned ſeem to be.) On the left Corner, over the Door, is <hi>Dutton</hi> of <hi>Dutton</hi>'s Coat, <hi>viz. Quarterly, a Fret in the ſecond and third Quarters.</hi> On the right-hand Corner, oppoſite thereunto, <hi>A Pale Fuſils,</hi> which was the Coat of the Priory of <hi>Norton,</hi> and is found frequently in the Windows of <hi>Norton.</hi> And in the middle, between theſe two Coats of Arms, in a Flat is engraven, for <hi>Warbutton</hi> of <hi>Arley</hi>'s Coat, <hi>A Cheveron between three Cormorants,</hi> (which is not <hi>Warburton</hi>'s proper Coat); on the one ſide whereof is written <hi>[John],</hi> and on the other ſide, <hi>[Warburton Knight.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſame three Coats are alſo above the great Window on the ſame Weſt-ſide of the Steeple. Certainly the <hi>Fret</hi> in <hi>Dutton</hi>'s Coat was not added before the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. And the firſt Sir <hi>John Warburton</hi> of <hi>Arley</hi> was he who was one of the Knights of the Body to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and was Sheriff of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> for his life, and died 15 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 1524. And therefore it ſhould ſeem the Steeple was repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again not many Ages ſince, about the beginning of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. or in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. at moſt.</p>
                        <p>Certain it is, That the Church of <hi>Great Budworth</hi> was given to the Priory of <hi>Norton,</hi> by <hi>William</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> the younger, and Baron of <hi>Halton,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, about the end of his Reign, <hi>Lib. B. pag.</hi> 199. <hi>num.</hi> 1. which <hi>Roger de Lacy</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> afterwards confirmed. See <hi>Monaſt. Anglican. Pars</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 185.</p>
                        <p>And after the Diſſolution of Abbies by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, he gave the Rectories of <hi>Budworth</hi> and <hi>Runcorne</hi> unto <hi>Chriſt-Church-College</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> by Special Grant, dated 11 <hi>die Decembris,</hi> 38 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 1546. So this Church of <hi>Great Budworth</hi> hath now the College of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> for its Patron, and is now but a Vicarage, worth about 80 <hi>
                              <abbr>l.</abbr> per Annum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this Church is yet the Caſe of a fair Organ, having the Coats of Arms of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton</hi> of <hi>Arley, Leyceſter</hi> of <hi>Tabley,</hi> and <hi>Merbury</hi> of <hi>Merbury,</hi> carved thereon. Theſe Organs (as Tradition hath it) came frem <hi>Norton,</hi> bought after the Diſſolution of that Priory, and were in good Order, till the Pipes thereof were taken out and ſpoiled by the Parliament Soldiers in the late War, 1647. which ſome <hi>Scotchmen</hi> among them called—<hi>Whistles in a Box.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Pariſh of <hi>Budworth</hi> is the largeſt Pariſh of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> next to that of <hi>Preſtbury;</hi> and it comprehendeth theſe Villages following, beſides the Parochial Chappelries of <hi>Witton</hi> and <hi>Nether-Pever,</hi> within the ſame.</p>

                        <p>Here is a Hamlet in <hi>Hale,</hi> called <hi>Ringey,</hi> wherein is ſituated a Chappel of Eaſe, called <hi>Ringey-Chappel,</hi> within the Pariſh of <hi>Bowdon;</hi> of which I have little to ſay, ſave that it was much frequented in the late War by Schiſmatical Miniſters, and, as it were, a Receptacle for Non-Conformiſts; in which diſſolute Times, every Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Illiterate Perſon, as the Humor ſerved him, ſtepp'd into the Pulpit, without any Lawful Calling thereunto, or Licence of Authority.</p>

                        <p>It is now a poor Town or Village; and the Inhabitants, that have any Lands of Inheritance there, are all Copy-holders to the King, as Baron of <hi>Halton;</hi> ſave two ſmall Cottages now, 1666. in poſſeſſion of <hi>John Jackſon</hi> and <hi>Richard Jennings,</hi> which are of the Fee of <hi>St. John of Hieruſalem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Caſtle was built by the Barons of <hi>Halton</hi> preſently after the <hi>Norman Conqueſt,</hi> and by degrees Repaired and Enlarged; who being Seated here, flouriſhed for a long time, and were Conſtables of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> in Fee, that is, to them and their Heirs by Deſcent; as it were, after the manner of Lord High Conſtables of <hi>England,</hi> ſo were the Barons of <hi>Halton</hi> to the Earls of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and in their Ancient Charters did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtile themſelves by the Title of <hi>[Conſtabularius Ceſtriae] Conſtables of Cheſhire;</hi> and were the Higheſt in Place and Dignity next to the Earl himſelf, and above all the other Barons of <hi>Cheſhire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third their Poſterity became Earls of <hi>Lincoln:</hi> And upon the Death of <hi>Henry Lacy</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> 1310. all his Lands and Honors came to the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> with <hi>Alice</hi> his Daughter and Heir in Marriage: And at laſt <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> Son of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> was ſo Great a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſo Popular, that he drew unto his Part moſt of the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby moſt Traiterouſly and Rebelliouſly Depoſed <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and made himſelf King of <hi>England</hi> by the Name of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth.</p>
                        <p>So was the Barony of <hi>Halton</hi> annexed to the Crown.</p>

                           <p>Concerning this <hi>Alice,</hi> and one <hi>Richard de St. Martin,</hi> I ſhall give you here the Story out of <hi>Walſingham, ſub Anno</hi> 1317. 10 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 108, 109.</p>

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55739:142"/>
many of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>being aſſiſtant to that deteſtable Fact, and by the Kings Aſſent, as it was ſaid: She was brought in great Triumph to the Earl</hi> Warren<hi>'s Caſtle of</hi> Ryegate, <hi>in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of her Husband</hi> Thomas <hi>Earl of</hi> Lancaſter; <hi>and by the way, the Conductors ſuppoſing they had ſeen Flags or Banners between the Hedges and Woods of</hi> Halton <hi>and</hi> Farnham <hi>afar off, (which was nothing but Prieſts in their Surplices walking Proceſſion with the People in the Fields, according to their Cuſtom) were ſtruck with a great fear, thinking the Earl of</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter <hi>her Husband had been coming with a Power to revenge her Injury; and ſo ran away, leaving the Lady almoſt all alone: But the matter being diſcovered, they returned with Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Pomp; with whom there was a low, lame, hulch-back'd Fellow, of a malicious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, called</hi> Richard dè St. Martin, <hi>who being backed with great Aid, challenged the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly-derided Lady for his Wife, proteſting that he carnally knew her before ſhe married the Earl of</hi> Lancaſter; <hi>which ſhe openly acknowledged to be true: And although ſhe was reputed a moſt Noble Lady all her life-time before, ſhe was by the Wheel of Fortune proclaimed an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Strumpet: And the ſaid</hi> Richard <hi>triumphing over her, preſumes to challenge the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of</hi> Lincoln <hi>and</hi> Salisbury <hi>in the King's Court, as in Right of his Wife; but in vain, as ſhall after appear more fully.</hi> Thus <hi>Walſingham.</hi>

                           <p>But here ſeems to be great improbability in this Story. <hi>Cambden</hi> tells us out of the Book of <hi>Stanlaw</hi> Monaſtery, that ſhe was but nine Years old when ſhe married <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaſter: Lincolnſhire, pag.</hi> 409. And then <hi>St. Martin</hi> muſt lie with her before ſhe was nine Years old, which is not probable. And then theſe Actions and Words done and ſaid unto her in time of Hoſtility, to make the Earl odious, might be given out againſt her, as if ſhe had confeſſed the Fact; though perhaps an abſolute Falſity. Nor is it likely <hi>Eubulo</hi> Lord <hi>Strange</hi> would have married her, as he did, had theſe things been true which are here related by <hi>Walſingham.</hi>

                        <p>Theſe little Villages are both of the Fee of the ancient Barony of <hi>Halton,</hi> and were formerly Copy-hold Land to the Manor of <hi>Halton,</hi> until the ſeveral Owners bought out their Lands in Fee-farm, to hold in Free and Common <hi>Soccage</hi> of the Mannor of <hi>Enfield</hi> in <hi>Middleſex;</hi> the King's Grant bearing date the ninth day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> 4 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. 1628. as you may ſee alſo above in <hi>Moore.</hi>

                        <p>Some Lands in theſe Townſhips are ancient Free-hold Land: For Sir <hi>Hugh Dutton</hi> of <hi>Dutton,</hi> by Office taken at <hi>Frodſham,</hi> 22 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. 1294. was found to hold ſeven <hi>Bovates</hi> of Land in <hi>Runcorn,</hi> with other Lands, of the Honor of <hi>Halton;</hi> which are termed <hi>The third Part of Over-Runcorn,</hi> in the <hi>Feodary</hi> of <hi>Halton: Vide ſupra,</hi> at the end of <hi>Halton:</hi> But theſe Lands were ſold lately by <hi>Gilbert</hi> Lord <hi>Gerard,</hi> unto <hi>Savage</hi> of <hi>Rock-Savage,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>James.</hi>

                        <p>In this Townſhip there is an Ancient Chappel, called <hi>Over-Tabley-Chappel,</hi> or more generally known by the name of <hi>The Chappel in the Street;</hi> for it is ſituate in the High-ſtreet: An old pitiful Structure, ill ſeated, and now in decay. This Chappel of Eaſe, being within the Pariſh of <hi>Roſthorn,</hi> was built about the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, by the Anceſtors of <hi>Leyceſter</hi> of <hi>Nether-Tabley</hi> and <hi>Daniell</hi> of <hi>Over-Tabley,</hi> for the Eaſe and Convenience of theſe two Families, and of all their Tenants in <hi>Over-Tabley</hi> and <hi>Nether-Tabley:</hi> Probably after the Match of <hi>Thomas Daniell</hi> and <hi>Maud Leyceſter,</hi> which was in <hi>Anno Dimini</hi> 1440. 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. It ſeems to be erected not long after, for Convenience of both Families, and placed in the middle-way between the two Houſes; one half of the ſaid Chappel belonging to <hi>Leyceſter</hi> and his Tenants, and the other half to <hi>Daniell</hi> and his Tenants; and ſo hath been enjoyed ever ſince accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Before this Chappel was erected here in <hi>Over-Tabley,</hi> there was anciently a Chappel ſituate in <hi>Nether-Tabley,</hi> within the Pariſh of <hi>Great-Budworth,</hi> in a certain Field cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at this day <hi>The Chappel-Field,</hi> Parcel of the Demain-Land of <hi>Nether-Tabley;</hi> where, within our Memory, Servants in Ploughing have diſcovered Great Stones, which were the Foundation-Stones of that Chappel, ſeated in the very uppermoſt Corner of the Great-Rye-Field-Hedge adjoining to the <hi>Chappel-Field:</hi> But this Chappel, I conceive, was neglected, or taken down, upon the erecting of the other in <hi>Over-Tabley,</hi> and was much better Seated.</p>

de Venables Militibus, Roberto le Groſvenour Vicecomite Geſterſhiriae,—&amp;c.</hi> This was about 1286. The Original of which Deed is now among the Evidences of the Earl of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> 1667.</p>
                        <p>So that it ſhould ſeem to me, that in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, one Moiety of <hi>Tatton</hi> was held of the Baron of <hi>Dunham-Maſſy,</hi> and the other Moiety of the Prior of <hi>St. John of Hieruſalem.</hi> That of the Fee of <hi>John of Hieruſalem,</hi> probably was the Moiety that in the <hi>Conqueror</hi>'s Time belonged to the Barony of <hi>Halton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is manifeſt by Deed, That <hi>Alan</hi> Son of <hi>Alan de Tatton</hi> Releaſed to <hi>Helen Manwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> and her Heirs, and to <hi>Robert Manwaring</hi> and his Heirs, <hi>ſequelam Halmoti mei de Tatton.</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the Third: <hi>Lib. C. fol.</hi> 135. <hi>num.</hi> 34.</p>
                        <p>So that <hi>Alan de Tatton</hi> ſeems to have the Royalty of all <hi>Tatton;</hi> and he grants the Land called <hi>Bruchel,</hi> in <hi>Tatton,</hi> unto <hi>William</hi> Son of <hi>William Maſſy: Ibid. num.</hi> 36. But whether he had any more than a Moiety of the Town, I cannot affirm; in regard we ſee above, <hi>William</hi> Son of <hi>William</hi> Son of <hi>Quenild</hi> of <hi>Tatton</hi> had a good part.</p>

Certain it is, that Sir <hi>Richard Maſſy</hi> was poſſeſſed of all or moſt part of <hi>Tatton,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, by Purchaſes of ſeveral Parcels; whoſe Heirs are now poſſeſſed of the whole Manor, 1667. which the following Pedegree will more clearly manifeſt.</p>

                        <p>This Saint <hi>Werburge</hi> was the Daughter of <hi>Wolfere</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> a Holy Virgin, whoſe Feaſt is celebrated uſually on the ſixteenth day of <hi>June:</hi> Some Almanacks place it to the 21 of <hi>June.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Certain it is, that it gave the occaſion of the Sir-name of <hi>Warburton</hi> to the Lords and Owners thereof: For the Poſterity of that <hi>Adam de Dutton</hi> coming to reſide at <hi>Warburton</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, <hi>Peter de Dutton</hi> was then ſtiled <hi>Peter de Warbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> from the Place of his Reſidence, as was the manner and cuſtom of thoſe Ages; which Sir-name of <hi>Warburton</hi> his Heirs have ever ſince wholly retained to this day.

                              <p>The Work of this Chart is to teſtifie and publiſh the Truth, ſo as the Knights and Sergeants who are to try the Right thereof upon the Plea aforeſaid, and all others who are not to meddle therewith, may be inſtructed to which of the Parties aforeſaid the Right doth appertain; and that they be not inveagled, by concealment of the Truth, to diſinherit him that hath Right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, to the Peril of their Souls.</p>
                              <p>Theſe give you to underſtand, That the ſaid Sir <hi>Rafe</hi> in the beginning of his Sickneſs (whereof he died) came unto me before <hi>Reynes,</hi> and ſaid unto me, That before he went into <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> he had enfeoffed certain Chaplains, that is to ſay, <hi>John Spendelow,</hi> and others, of the ſaid Manour, and of all the other Lands aforeſaid, on certain Conditions compriſed in certain Indentures made between them; and reckoned up the Conditions to me, and ſaid, the Conditions were yet depending on his Will and Ordinance: And there he ſaid in my preſence, That his Heritage ſhould not be divided nor diſmembred by no means; but ordained then and there, before me, That if he died in this Voyage, the ſaid Chaplains ſhould enfeoff, <hi>John de Leyceſter</hi> his Nephew of all his ſaid Heritage, to him and to his Heirs, as entirely as the ſaid Chaplains were enfeoffed thereof by him: And prayed me, in the Work of Charity, that I would Record, Witneſs, and openly declare his ſaid Ordinance and Will to all that it might concern, and to all the Deeds which he had made, when time required: And that in the mean time this was to be kept private, becauſe of his Wife; for he ſaid, he had a Daughter, which he held not to be his Daughter, who ſhould never inherit any of his Heritage, nor any other, ſave onely the ſaid <hi>John de Leyceſter:</hi> And afterwards, a little before he died, I ſent a certain Meſſenger (whom I firmly truſted) to the ſaid Sir <hi>Rafe,</hi> to move him on the behalf of his Daughter, to ſee whether he was in the ſame mind (as formerly) towards the ſaid <hi>John de Leyceſter,</hi> and as he was at our laſt Conference aboveſaid: By which Meſſenger he certified me, That he had fully granted and aſſigned to the ſaid <hi>John de Leyceſter</hi> all his Heritage, in manner as before me he had ordained, and is above-mentioned; and that neither his Daughter, nor his Wife, nor any other, ſave the ſaid <hi>John de Leyceſter,</hi> ſhould ever have any of his Heritage: And prayed me, for the Love of God, that I would ſee his ſaid Ordinance towards his ſaid Nephew might be performed in manner aforeſaid, as it was made before me. Which Will and Ordinance was ſpoken before me by the ſaid Sir <hi>Rafe,</hi> as is above-mentioned: And, as I deſire to anſwer it before God, I have witneſſed and publiſhed the ſame before our thrice honourable Lord the Prince, and before many other Grave and Wiſe Men, as well Judges and Men of Holy Church, as before other Knights, that they hold the ſaid Ordinance good and ſufficient, and this my ſaid Teſtimony to be true. Wherefore may it pleaſe you to give faith and credence to this my Teſtimony, which, before God, on pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of a Curſe, I avow to be faithful. And in caſe, that there may not be any who may doubt of this my Teſtimony made in this my Letter, becauſe I am ſo much employed in the Affairs of my ſaid Lord the Prince, that I cannot come ſpeedily into thoſe Parts, if he pleaſe to travel ſo far as to come where I am, I ſhall be ready to make good my ſaid Teſtimony by all reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ways which a Man of Worth ſhall deſire me: For, to do this, I am bound by my own Grant, made to the ſaid Sir <hi>Rafe</hi> at the time when he ſhewed me his ſaid Will and Ordinance in manner aboveſaid.

                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards, about the Year of our Lord 1377. another Conteſt fell between <hi>John Domvill</hi> of <hi>Mobberley</hi> and <hi>Cicely</hi> his Wife on the one part, and <hi>John Leyceſter</hi> aforeſaid on the other part, concerning theſe Lands of Sir <hi>Rafe Mobberley</hi> of <hi>Mobberley:</hi> which <hi>John Domvill</hi> challenged in Right of <hi>Cicely</hi> his Wife, as ſole Heir and Siſter of the Whole Blood to Sir <hi>Rafe</hi> her Brother. Whereupon the ſame <hi>John Leyceſter, John Domvill,</hi> and <hi>Cicely,</hi> were ſworn at <hi>Knotsford,</hi> before Sir <hi>John Maſſy</hi> Parſon of <hi>Stopport, Thomas Fitton</hi> of <hi>Gaweſworth, Thomas de Whyllok, John de Hatton, John de Damport,</hi> and many others, <hi>ſur la Corps de Jheſu Chriſt ſacred, &amp;c.</hi> to ſtand to the Ordinance of Sir <hi>Thomas Dutton, Hugh Venables</hi> of <hi>Kinderton,</hi> Sir <hi>John Maſſy</hi> Parſon of <hi>Stopport, Thomas de Whyllok, Thomas Fitton</hi> of <hi>Gaweſworth, William de Stanley, Robert le Groſve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, John de Olton, John de Damport,</hi> and <hi>David de Calveley:</hi> to wit, <hi>That the ſaid</hi> John Domvil <hi>and</hi> Cicely <hi>his Wife, and</hi> John Leyceſter, <hi>ſhall put all their Right in the Manor of</hi> Mobberley <hi>to the Ordinance of the Perſons aforeſaid: And another Point is, That the ſaid</hi> John Domvill <hi>&amp;</hi> Cicely <hi>his Wife, and the ſaid</hi> John Leyceſter, <hi>ſhall ſhake hands, and charge the Arbitrators aforeſaid (as they will anſwer it) to award nothing on either Part, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Right: And alſo that neither Party do make Grievance one to the other, till the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators have made their Ordinance; and alſo that the ſaid</hi> John Domvill <hi>and</hi> Cicely <hi>make no delay, by reaſon they have got the Poſſeſſion of the Manor, but may hold what the Award ſhall render according to all their Power: And if any of the Perſons aforenamed be contrary to Reaſon, that the reſt of them ſhall chuſe other reaſonable Men in their place: And alſo, that if theſe Perſons aboveſaid cannot agree of their Ordinance, then to take others at their choice where they pleaſe.</hi>

                  <p>The Original is in <hi>French,</hi> but hath no date; and remains among the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of <hi>Leyceſter</hi> of <hi>Toft,</hi> 1672. <hi>M. num.</hi> 5. <hi>Lib. C. fol.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>So that I conjecture <hi>Cicely</hi> was the onely Siſter to Sir <hi>Rafe</hi> by the firſt Wife of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de Mobberley;</hi> for otherwiſe the other Siſters of Sir <hi>Rafe</hi> would have challenged <hi>Mobberley</hi> Lands, as well as <hi>Cicely:</hi> which other Siſters were Daughters of <hi>William de Mobberley</hi> by <hi>Maud Downes</hi> of <hi>Chorley</hi> his later Wife, and ſhared their Mothers Land in <hi>Chorley,</hi> as Co-heirs; whereunto I find not that the ſaid <hi>Cicely</hi> ever made any Claim: <hi>Lib. C. fol.</hi> 21. <hi>C. num.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>But how that could avoid the Settlement on <hi>John Leyceſter,</hi> by the Chaplains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffed by Sir <hi>Rafe Mobberley</hi> before-mentioned; or what was the Award of the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators elected between <hi>John Leyceſter,</hi> and <hi>John Domvill</hi> and <hi>Cicely</hi> his Wife, at <hi>Knotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> I find not poſitively and directly.</p>
                  <p>Onely I find, ſo it was, That <hi>John Domvill</hi> and <hi>Cicely</hi> his Wife did levy a Fine at <hi>Cheſter, die Martis proximè poſt Feſtum Sancti Petri in Cathedrâ, Anno primo Ricardi ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundi,</hi> (that is, in <hi>January,</hi> 1377.) unto <hi>John Brunſtath</hi> Parſon of <hi>Mobberley, John Brereton</hi> Chaplain, <hi>Thomas Fitton</hi> of <hi>Gaweſworth,</hi> and <hi>Robert Groſvenour,</hi> of 35 Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuages, 627 Acres of Land, 100 Acres of Wood, 20 Acres of Paſture, 120 Acres of Moor, the Rent of two Pair of Gloves, two Parts of a Water-mill, <hi>&amp; tertiâ parte unius Molendini Fullonici,</hi> with the Appurtenances in <hi>Mobberley,</hi> and <hi>Tatton:</hi>— together with the Homages and Services of <hi>Rafe Leyceſter, John Lawrenſon</hi> of <hi>Mobber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,

                  <p>And theſe are the Lands in <hi>Mobberley</hi> belonging to <hi>Leyceſter</hi> of <hi>Toft</hi> at this day, 1672. who are deſcended from <hi>Rafe Leyceſter</hi> aboveſaid; about a third part of Sir <hi>Rafe Mob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berley</hi>'s Moiety of <hi>Mobberley.</hi>

                  <p>Again, we may obſerve out of the Deeds above-mentioned, That <hi>John Leyceſter</hi> and <hi>Rafe Leyceſter</hi> were Brothers, both Sons of <hi>Nicolas Leyceſter</hi> of <hi>Tabley,</hi> by <hi>Mary</hi> Daughter of <hi>William de Mobberley,</hi> and Nephews to Sir <hi>Rafe Mobberley</hi> of <hi>Mobberley</hi> aforeſaid, clearly ſo proved. <hi>John</hi> was Son and Heir of <hi>Nicolas,</hi> and <hi>Rafe</hi> younger Brother to <hi>John.</hi>

                  <p>It is obſervable alſo, That this <hi>Rafe Leyceſter</hi> had ſome Land in <hi>Mobberley,</hi> before thoſe given him by the Feoffees, 1379. whereof the Homage and Service is mentioned in the Fine of 1 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2.
